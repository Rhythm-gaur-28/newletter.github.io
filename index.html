                Akshay Kumar is set for a rematch at the box office after a series of underwhelming performances by his recent releases including 'Bade Miyan Chote Miyan', 'Mission Raniganj' and 'Selfiee'. The actor is now returning to the big screen with his latest film, 'Sarfira', a Hindi remake of the 2020 Tamil hit 'Soorarai Pottru', which starred Suriya and Aparna Balamurali.Early reports suggest that Sarfira sold just 2,700 tickets for over 800 shows, grossing around Rs 4.8 lakh on its first day of advance bookings, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. Despite the slow start, Akshay's star power has seemingly boosted ticket sales with reports on Wednesday stating that the film saw a significant surge in bookings.

We throw our spoons, three spoons each, and we start the stopwatch. We each have to go and collect three spoons...and come back and turn off the stopwatch. We'd love to show it to you!"Decked out in a stylish black one-piece and goggles, she and someone else, likely her son Samuel, jetted off into the water and completed the mission, but when Garner looked at the stopwatch, she commented, "We have a lot of work to do."

                Meagan Good plays a woman working through divorce in her latest movie. She says she’s bringing her own experiences to the screen. The 42-year-old actor visited TODAY with Hoda & Jenna July 9 to discuss her role in Tyler Perry’s “Divorce in the Black.” She said she channeled feelings from her 2021 divorce from DeVon Franklin to help people “feel seen” and “give them empowerment.”“I was happy to just delve into this role because of (Ava’s) journey. Once she accepted what was happening and she realized there was nothing that she could do about it, then she had to get excited about the second act of her life,” Good said of her role. “And I understand that feeling very, very intimately.”
